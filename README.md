This repository was meant to be the main-code of a college project. We were going to build a whole Tetris game based on Python's library PyGame.
Unfortunately, it was discontinued due to the fact that I didn't even knew OOP by the time.

Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine, et lux perpetua luceat eis.
Requiescat in pace.
